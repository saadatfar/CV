%%%%%%%%%% Projects %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

	\cvsection{Projects}
	\cvproject{Solatrix™ Fractional Thermo-mechanical Device}{}{2020}
	\justifying \noindent
	Solatrix is a fractional thermo-mechanical device that has a significant effect on the rejuvenation and removal of skin lesions by transferring direct heat to the skin. The high-temperature (400°C) titanium tip of the device transfers heat to the skin with extremely low invasion; and by stimulating collagen production, it causes rejuvenation and eliminates wrinkles. The heat can be controlled by the contact time of the tip with the skin and the penetration depth of the tip. \par

\vbox{ %
	\cvproject{MadamX™ Vaginal RF Device}{https://mersateb.com/en/madamx/}{2019}
	\justifying \noindent
	The vaginal RF technology exposes the inner and outer parts of vagina to high frequency radio waves emitted from safe electrodes with remarkable results. High-energy and long-lasting RF waves is an effective treatment without any complication that can heat lower layers and muscles with monopolar and multipolar functions without heating the skin or the mucous membrane. \par
	\divider
}

\vbox{ %
	\cvproject{Firebolt™ Plasma Device}{https://mersateb.com/en/firebolt/}{2018}
	\justifying \noindent
	The Firebolt plasma device transfers high-frequency plasma energy to the skin. This energy is used in various treatments such as blepharoplasty and the removal of moles, freckles, and wrinkles. The released energy generates a heating action on the skin surface that removes the old, damaged epidermis and dermis cells, thus triggering collagen creation. The exclusive features of the Firebolt plasma device are its high safety, various treatment indications, and its therapeutic performance without side effects. \par
	\divider

\vbox{ %
	\cvproject{Nettle™ Fractional RF Device}{https://mersateb.com/en/nettle/}{2018}
	\justifying \noindent
	The fractional RF technology applies high-frequency and minimally-intrusive radio waves to specific skin layers to produce heat, which stimulates fibroblasts and produces collagen and elastin. Ultimately, this process significantly contributes to skin rejuvenation. Fractional RF applies radio waves to the skin with fractional needles and can produce different effects in the skin’s lower layers without exposing the skin surface to heat; thus, significantly reducing treatment side effects. \par

\vbox{ %
	\cvproject{Hurricane™ Carboxytherapy Device}{https://mersateb.com/en/hurricane/}{2019}
	\justifying \noindent
	The device starts a series of interconnected reactions after controlled and continuous injections of CO2 and leads to some changes like vasodilation, an increase in blood flow, and an increase in body temperature. The blood flow increase leads to the oxygenation of the intended area which itself helps the metabolism increase, tissue rejuvenation, and detoxification and it finally causes rejuvenation and cellulitis decrease in the intended tissue. \par
