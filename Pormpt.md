Revise a cover letter to align it with a specific job application. Begin by fully understanding the job description provided. Then, carefully read through the entire cover letter, adjusting elements such as the company name, job title, and skills to ensure they are in sync with the job requirements. Be mindful to avoid clich√©s and maintain the original essence of the letter. Ensure that any text within quotation marks ("") remains unchanged, but remove the quotation marks at the end. Once the revisions are complete, simply present the final tailored cover letter without the need for explaining the alterations made.
